PUSHING A NEW REPO TO GITHUB:


1. Create a remote, empty folder/repository on Github.

    1. Login to your Github account.

    2. At the top right of any Github page, you should see a '+' icon. Click that, then select 'New Repository'.

    3. Give your repository a name--ideally the same name as your local project. If I'm building a travel application, its folder will be called 'travel-app' on my computer, and 'travel-app' will be the Github repository name as well.

    4. Click 'Create Repository'. The next screen you see will be important, so don't close it.


    5. Name the repository and copy the .git link 



In the terminal: 
	1. git init 
	2. git remote add origin [copied .git link]
	3. git add -A
	4. touch README.md
	5. echo "Text for README.md" > README.md
	6. git commit -m "commit message"
	7. git push origin master
